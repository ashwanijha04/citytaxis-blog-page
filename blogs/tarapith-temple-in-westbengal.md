## Historical and Mythological Significance

### **Origins of Tarapith**

The name **Tarapith** is derived from the Sanskrit words "Tara" (a form of the Goddess) and "Pith" (sacred place). According to Hindu mythology, **Tarapith is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas**, where the *third eye* of **Goddess Sati** is believed to have fallen when Lord Shiva carried her burnt body across the universe. This makes the temple a sacred place of divine power and mysticism.*

## The Tarapith Temple

### **Architecture and Idol of Goddess Tara**

The **Tarapith temple** is a classic example of **Bengali temple architecture**, with a curvilinear structure and red-brick walls adorned with intricate carvings. The sanctum sanctorum houses **a black stone idol** of **Goddess Tara**, covered in red and gold garments with a silver face mask.

The idol has **large, hypnotic eyes**, symbolizing her all-seeing nature, and she is depicted holding a skull, signifying destruction and rebirth.

**Unique Rituals and Practices**

Unlike many traditional Hindu temples, **Tarapith is known for its Tantric worship**, which includes unusual rituals performed by ascetics and devotees.

- **Offerings of meat and liquor**: Unlike mainstream Hindu temples where vegetarian offerings are common, here, the Goddess is offered non-vegetarian items, symbolizing the Tantric philosophy of breaking norms.
- **Sadhus and Aghoris**: Many Tantric practitioners, known as **Aghori Sadhus**, reside near the temple and perform esoteric rituals in the adjoining cremation ground.
- **Midnight worships**: Devotees believe that **Maa Tara grants wishes when worshipped at midnight**.

The **Maha Smashan** (Cremation Ground)

- The cremation ground is **active 24/7**, with **pyres burning continuously**.
- Tantric rituals, including **Shava Sadhana (meditating on a corpse)**, are performed here.
